## üîç Real-Life Analogy: "Searching for a Book in a Library"

Imagine you're in a library, and the books are sorted in alphabetical order. Your goal is to find a specific book.

### üîÅ How would you do it manually?

1. Start by looking at the **middle book** in the shelf.
2. If the book you're searching for is **alphabetically before** the middle book, you know the book must be in the left half of the shelf.
3. If the book you're looking for is **alphabetically after** the middle book, it must be in the right half of the shelf.
4. Keep **dividing the shelf** into halves and repeating the process, always focusing on the middle book of the remaining shelf, until you find the book or narrow down to one last option.

This method reduces the number of books you need to search through at each step, making it **faster** than searching book by book.
