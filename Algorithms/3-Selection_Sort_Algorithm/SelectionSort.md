## ✅ What is Selection Sort?

### Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm.

It works by repeatedly selecting the **smallest** (or **largest**) element from the **unsorted** portion of the list and **swapping** it with the first unsorted element.

### 📊 Time & Space Complexity

- **Worst Case:** O(n²)  
- **Best Case:** O(n²)  
- **Average Case:** O(n²)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) *(in-place sorting)*

---

## 🧠 Algorithm Steps:

1. Start from the **first element**.
2. Find the **smallest element** in the remaining array.
3. **Swap** it with the first unsorted element.
4. Move to the **next position**.
5. **Repeat** until the array is sorted.

## ✅ Real-Life Analogy: *"Picking the Cheapest Product from a Shelf"*

Imagine you're at a store, trying to buy items in the **cheapest-to-most-expensive** order.  
All prices are visible, but the items are **randomly placed** on the shelf.

---

### 🔁 How would you do it manually?

1. You scan the **entire shelf** and find the **cheapest item**.
2. You take that item and **place it at the beginning** of your cart.
3. Then, you look at the **remaining items**, find the next cheapest one, and place it in the **next position**.
4. Repeat this process — **each time selecting the smallest** from the unsorted items — until all items are sorted in your cart.

---

You always **select** the minimum and **move it to the correct position** —  
that's the essence of **Selection Sort**.
