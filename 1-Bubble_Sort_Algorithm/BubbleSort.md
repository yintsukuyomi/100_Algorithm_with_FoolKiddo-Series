## 🫧 Real-Life Analogy: "Kids Lining Up by Height"

Imagine you have a group of kids standing in a random order, and your goal is to line them up **from shortest to tallest**.

---

### 🔁 How would you do it manually?

1. You look at the **first two kids** in line.
2. If the one on the **left is taller** than the one on the right, they **swap places**.
3. Move one step to the right and **repeat the comparison**.
4. By the end of the first pass, the **tallest kid "bubbles up" to the end**.
5. On the next pass, repeat the process, but **ignore the last (already sorted) kid**.
6. Keep going until **no more swaps are needed** — now the line is fully sorted.

This is the essence of **Bubble Sort** — simple, logical, and step-by-step.
